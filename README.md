# bitcoinsv-elixir

Since bitcoin SV network has started, we need a cloud wallet server which can address the need for mainstream users, especially for business / organization / merchants who wants to be connected to the MetaNet. which is an important platform for the future
IoV (Internet of Value). The core difference between classical internet and MetaNet is the additional blockchain layer on top of TCPIP. since many important feature requires a bitcoin node for operations on addresses, signatures, transactions and scripts,
we need a flexiable and high performance node implementation for billions of users (humans & machines).

## Simple bitcoinsv wallet

**initialize wallet**
```ex
w = Bitcoin.Cli.new_wallet "8b559565ec6754895b6f378fa935740e34bb7d9b515ade65c6dc06081e3b63c7" # private key only for testing
Bitcoin.Cli.get_balance w
```

how to send data embeded tx
```ex
outputs = [%{type: "safe", data: "ÊàëÁúüÁâõüç∫ "}]
Bitcoin.Cli.transfer(w, outputs)
```

normal tx(p2pkh)

outputs = [{
    "1PVCqdqyEWGbzyBRLXptjG3n3AzaJtrsFp", # address
    1000 # amount (satoshis)
    }]
```

**upload file with B:// protocol**
```ex
outputs = [
    Bitcoin.Metanet.B.build_output("./google_logo.png")
]

# or use upload function
Bitcoin.Metanet.B.upload(w, "./google_logo.png")

# see the tx here: https://whatsonchain.com/tx/a921293e982d76e45f8cd1e9b515ea950cfb440d8b7cb52aa6eeb404aa26b9a5
